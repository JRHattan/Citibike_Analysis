# Citibike_Analysis
 
#Purpose:

#Within class, this served to introduce us to Tableau, and show off some of its simpler features. Within the excercise, we found when the bikes are used most, who uses them, and 
whether or not they have a subscription. This allows the company to schedule maitenence, and market appropriately.

#Summaries:

#within the challenge Modules, Checkout times for users shows a sharp rise until about 5 hours, then a sharp decline.

#Checkout times by gender shows men consistently rent more than women.

#Trips by Weekday Hour shows most hours of the day are relatively quiet, but saturdays are relatviely busy during what would be business hours and weekdays are busy when people travel to and from work.

#Trips by Weekday by gender shows this trend holds true across gender, even if males still rent more by quantity.

#User Trips by gender by weekday shows the bulk of the customers are male subscribers, but more women are subscribers than customers.

#Average Hours shows nights are the best time to schedule maintenence.

#Finally, most of the traffic starts in central Manhattan, and programs could be considered to shuttle bikes in from the outskirts.

#Going Forward

#overall, the marketing shows the company is trending well with men, so they should likely try and focus on getting new women onto subsription. While they ideally want more subscribers, they could also consider offering a bonus/incentive to those that aren't, such as a trial month or the current ride is free if you subscribe. Although the data may be hard to acquire, they could consider what demographics like their products the most (I.E. office workers, blue collar jobs, etc) and consider focusing on that market or expanding. It would also be ideal to see if any people stop on these trips, getting items like coffee or food on the way to work, and offering different bikes for different purposes (speed versus cargo capacity).
